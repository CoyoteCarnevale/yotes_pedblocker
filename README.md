# yotes_pedblocker
A small client side script for RedM using the CFX event populationPedCreating that blocks the spawning of a ped from both ambient and scenario populations.

I created this script after being unable to find any existing repositories that prevented a ped model from spawning at the source instead of just despawning ones that were already being created. Despawners work fine for one or two specific peds that you want to not spawn in an area (IE, removing bears from a camp ymap without disabling ALL bears in your server), but for widespread / multiple peds I found that it created weird visuals when the peds would respawn and despawn, and relied on you knowing the locations of all those spawns - this is just better all around!

Thank you to the Bryce Canyon County (BCC) community for assisting in research!
